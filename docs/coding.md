# Rust coding guide

Apply these rules with Tau's coding instructions to every Rust file in stomme, tests included. Where
the two differ, this guide wins. A Tau rule this guide does not change applies as written. The
reasons behind each rule are in [ADR 0004](./adr/0004-rust-coding-guide.md).

## Names

These names are exceptions to Tau's full-word naming rule.

- Keep a name that a standard or trait method requires, such as `fmt`.
- Use `T` for a generic type parameter and short names such as `'a` for lifetimes.

## Item order and modules

- Order items top-down: public and high-level items first, private helpers after the items that use
  them. This replaces Tau's rule to declare a helper before its caller.
- Store module `foo` in `foo.rs`, and its child modules in `foo/`. Never create `foo/mod.rs`.

## Errors

- Return a `Result` and propagate it with `?` for a failure that can happen at run time, such as bad
  input, a missing file, or a failed child process.
- Give an error its own type, derived with `thiserror`, when a caller branches on what failed. Put
  the data a caller needs in fields, not only in the message.
- Count a test that tells failures apart as a caller that branches.
- In app code that only reports an error, use `anyhow::Result` and add context with `.context(...)`
  or `.with_context(...)`. App code is `main` and the code that only passes errors up to it.
- Treat `xtask` as app code: its tasks report errors with `anyhow`, not with `String`.
- Panic only on a bug. Use `expect` with a message that says why the call cannot fail, such as
  `.expect("xtask lives one level below the workspace root")`.
- Never discard a `Result`. `let _ =`, `_ =`, `drop(result)`, and an unused `.ok()` all discard it.
  Propagate it, or handle the error in a `match` or `if let Err(error)`.
- In `Drop`, where no caller can take a cleanup error, print it with `eprintln!` inside
  `if let Err(error)`. Put `#[expect(clippy::print_stderr, reason = "...")]` on the `drop` method.

## Statements and expressions

- Write these forms inline: `?`, `if let`, `let ... else`, an `if` or `match` that produces a value,
  and a short iterator chain such as `names.iter().any(...)`. This replaces Tau's rules on call
  chains and ternary expressions.
- Name a chain with its own `let` when it is long, or when its result is a concept the reader should
  see by name, such as the rows a `for` loop walks.
- Use an `Option<T>` field for an optional value. Tau's spread rules do not apply to Rust.

## Function size

- Do not split an exhaustive `match` only to meet Tau's size review signals.

## Ownership

- Borrow a view to read: take `&str`, `&[T]`, and `&Path`, not `&String`, `&Vec<T>`, and `&PathBuf`.
- Take an owned value, such as `String`, `Vec<T>`, or `PathBuf`, when the function keeps it. Do not
  borrow and then clone inside.
- Clone on purpose. Before you write `.clone()`, check whether a move or a shorter borrow works.
- Suppress a lint with `#[expect(lint, reason = "...")]` on the smallest item that needs it. Use
  `#[allow(lint, reason = "...")]` only where the lint fires in some builds and not in others.

## Doc comments

- Write `///` doc comments only on items another crate uses.
- In a doc comment, state only errors, panics, and invariants the name and types cannot show.

## Tests

- Put unit tests in a `#[cfg(test)] mod tests` at the end of the file that owns the behavior.
- A test that touches the file system gets its folder from `tempfile`, through the shared helper in
  `xtask/src/test_support.rs` (or `tempfile` directly in other crates), never from a path built by
  hand. The `TempDir` guard must stay alive while the test uses its folder.
- Put a test that uses a crate from the outside in that crate's `tests/`. Keep as few targets as
  possible, usually one, such as `tests/integration/main.rs` with modules. Cargo builds each file in
  `tests/` as its own binary.
- Write a case table as an array and a plain `for` loop. Name the case in the assert message.
- Declare side effects as records of functions in the consuming module. Fake only an IO boundary,
  such as a child process, the file system, or the clock. Do not add single-implementation traits
  or fake pure code.
- Assert the error variant and its data with `assert!(matches!(...))` or `assert_eq!`, never only
  `is_err()`. Do not compare a human-readable message unless its exact text is a contract.
- Use `#[should_panic(expected = "...")]` only for code that panics on purpose.
- Treat a surviving mutant from `cargo xtask mutation` as advice, as Tau does.
